# Tuple Out Dice Game

## Description
Tuple Out is a dice game where players roll three dice to score points. If all dice show the same value ("Tuple Out"), the player scores zero points for that turn. Players can reroll unfixed dice to try for a higher score but must avoid rolling all the same value.

## How to Play
1. Each player takes turns rolling three dice.
2. Fixed dice (two of the same value) cannot be rerolled.
3. Players can reroll unfixed dice until satisfied or until they Tuple Out.

## Advanced Features
- **Roll Statistics**: Tracks roll outcomes for each player and provides a summary at the end.
- **Delays**: Adds timing between actions for enhanced gameplay.

## How to Run
1. Install Python and the Pandas library (`pip install pandas`).
2. Run the script using `python game.py`.
3. Follow the prompts to play the game.
